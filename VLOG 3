The week included 3 sessions ( 1 soft skills , 2 technical )
The first technical session was an introduction to Cybersecurity
We covered four modules in this week; these modules are:

          - Security baselining
          - Security concerns
          - Types of threats
          - Security controls
          - Risk management
          - Data in motion || data at rest 

  2- Publice key infrastructure (PKI):

          - PKI components
          - Certification authorities
          - Enabling trust

          - Establishing secure access
          - Network devices

After each session there was an assignments that we've took:
  - Discuss common challenges organizations face in implementing identity management solutions.
  - Provide examples of identity-related security incidents (e.g., account takeovers) and explain how they could have been prevented with proper identity management.
  ===============================================================================================================================

  • Choose a tool or programming language to encrypt a sample data file (e.g., OpenSSL, GPG, or a Python encryption library).
  • Document the steps to encrypt and decrypt the file, including the commands or code used.
  • Explain the significance of encryption in data security and how it protects data in transit and at rest.
