My fifth week at DEPI
The week included 3 sessions ( 1 soft skills , 2 technical )
We covered alot of useful topics about Pen-test:
 - We talked about the 5 phases of the penetration testing process:
 - Steps are (Planning , Scanning , Exploitation , Maintaining Access , and Reporting).
    1. Planning: 
    Define the scope, goals, and rules of engagement for the test. 
    This phase ensures legal and ethical boundaries are established and provides a clear understanding of the target environment.

    2. Scanning: 
    Gather information about the target by identifying open ports, 
    running services, and vulnerabilities through passive and active reconnaissance techniques.

    3. Exploitation: 
    Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access,
    simulating real-world attacks to understand the risks and impact.

    4. Maintaining Access: 
    Simulate how attackers establish persistent access to compromised systems,
    such as by installing backdoors, while avoiding detection.

    5. Reporting: 
    Document findings, including vulnerabilities, methods used, and potential impacts, with actionable recommendations for improving security.

I'm glad to take a real step of the penetration testing and waiting for the next sessions.
