This is my first vlog after attending the first week of the DEPI
The week included 3 sessions ( 1 soft skills , 2 technical )
The first technical session was an introduction to Cybersecurity
We covered four modules in this week; these modules are:
  1- Cyber security Awareness & Network Discovery.
          in this module we covered alot of useful infromation about cyber security awareness.
          - CIA triad
          - DAD triad
          - Security baselining
          - Security concerns
          - Types of threats
          - Security controls
          - Risk management
          - Data in motion || data at rest 

  2- Network Discovery
          - 1.Networking review
          - Discovery, footprinting, and scanning
          - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
          - Security policies
          - Vulnerabilities

  3- Systems Hardening.
          - What is hardening?
          - Types of systems that can be hardened
          - Mobile device management
          - AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting)
          - Physical security
          
  4- security architecture.
          - How to build a secure network architecture
          - Network devices
          - What is a Firewall
          - Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)
          - Firewalls, IDS and IPS

After each session there was an assignments that we've took:
  - Provide a definition of systems hardening and explain its importance in maintaining cybersecurity.
  - Discuss at least three different types of systems that can benefit from hardening (e.g.,servers, workstations, network devices).
  - Describe five common systems hardening techniques, including:
       1. Disabling unnecessary services
       2. Implementing least privilege access
       3. Patch management
       4. Configuration baselines
       5. Network segmentation

  + 2 labs on THM:
       1. Introductory Networking 
       2. Secure Network Architecture
